My attempt at recreating the Lens Fest and Lens Studio logos in the VFX Editor!  
No scripts, textures, or 3D models were used.

*** Caution: In Lens Studio 4.10.0, the use of multiple Output Quad modules in VFX Assets makes the software crash instantly. Please use a different version of Lens Studio to play around with these!
